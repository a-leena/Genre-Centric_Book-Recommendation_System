# Genre-Centric_Book-Recommendation_System
In this project a comprehensive Book-dataset is analyzed to uncover the relationships between authors, genres, and reader preferences. Through advanced analytics, author-genre associations and genre-based author communities are identified, and a robust recommendation system that suggests books to readers is developed based on the communities.
